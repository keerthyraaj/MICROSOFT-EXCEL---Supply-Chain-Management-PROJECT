# ANALYSIS ON SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT DATA – Microsoft Excel

# Tools: Microsoft Excel, Pivot Tables, Power Query, VLOOKUP/XLOOKUP

As part of an analytics project, I was required to analyze a large supply chain sales dataset and prepare it for structured
reporting and insight generation. I cleaned, validated, and standardized raw transactional data in Excel and used VLOOKUP to
categorize products, map customer and regional attributes, and correct inconsistent values by referencing lookup tables. I created derived metrics using Excel formulas and built Pivot Tables to analyze sales by product line, region, customer, deal size, and time period. I also calculated key supply chain KPIs such as total revenue, average order value, order status distribution, and sales trends, and designed an interactive dashboard with charts and slicers.
